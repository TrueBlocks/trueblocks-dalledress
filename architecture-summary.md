# Store-Owned Data Architecture

## Overview

This architecture implements a pattern where canonical data is owned by stores and facets maintain views into that data. This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Pointer Stability**: Objects stored in the store have stable memory addresses
2. **Clean Separation**: Facets are decoupled from data fetching logic
3. **Observer Pattern**: Changes in store data automatically propagate to facets
4. **Thread Safety**: Proper synchronization ensures data integrity
5. **Cancellation Support**: Unified handling of user cancellations

## Implementation Structure

### Enhanced Store (`pkg/enhancedstore`)

The store is responsible for:
- Fetching data from external sources
- Maintaining canonical data
- Notifying observers of changes
- Managing state transitions

Key components:
- `Store[T]`: Generic container that owns canonical data
- `FacetObserver[T]`: Interface for components observing the store
- `StoreState`: Enum representing the store's current state

### Enhanced Facet (`pkg/enhancedfacet`)

Facets provide:
- Filtered views into store data
- Transformation of store data for UI components
- Pagination and sorting
- Automatic background fetching

Key components:
- `BaseFacet[T]`: Maintains a view into the store's data
- `LoadState`: Enum representing the facet's current state
- `FilterFunc[T]`: Function type for filtering items

### Collections (`pkg/enhancedcollection`)

Collections demonstrate:
- How to implement domain-specific collections using the architecture
- Patterns for migrating existing collections
- Testing strategies for the new architecture

Examples:
- `NamesCollection`: Simple demonstration collection
- `ABIsCollection`: Example of a migrated domain collection

## Migration Approach

Our recommended approach is:

1. **Create parallel implementations** of the new architecture
2. **Test with real domain collections** to validate behavior
3. **Migrate collections one by one** to the new architecture
4. **Switch to integrated approach** once proven

## Testing Strategy

The architecture is tested through:
1. Unit tests of individual components
2. Integration tests of collections
3. Demo application showing end-to-end behavior
4. Manual testing of cancellation and state transitions

## Next Steps

- Complete testing of the parallel implementation
- Create a migration guide for domain collections
- Implement cancellation registry integration
- Evaluate performance characteristics
- Document API for developers
