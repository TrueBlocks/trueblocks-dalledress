# Fix Compilation Issues Plan

This document outlines the steps to fix the current compilation issues and ensure a clean migration to the new architecture.

## Current Issues

1. **Store Package Issues**:
   - `FacetObserver` and `StoreState` types are causing compilation errors
   - Added new fields to `Store` struct but they're unused
   - Added new methods but they're not properly implemented

2. **Facets Package Issues**:
   - Attempted to modify `BaseFacet` but the changes are incomplete
   - References to `view` instead of `data` in some methods
   - Observer implementation methods are causing compilation errors

## Fix Plan

### Step 1: Revert to a Clean Compilable State

1. **Store Package**:
   - Remove the `data`, `observers`, `state`, etc. fields from Store struct
   - Remove the FacetObserver interface for now
   - Ensure the package compiles cleanly

2. **Facets Package**:
   - Remove any observer implementation methods
   - Fix syntax errors in all files
   - Ensure all files have proper package declarations

### Step 2: Implement the New Architecture in Stages

1. First stage:
   - Add StoreState enum and constants to store package
   - Implement a separate ObservableStore that extends Store
   - Keep existing Store unchanged for compatibility

2. Second stage:
   - Create an EnhancedBaseFacet that implements the observer pattern
   - Make it compatible with ObservableStore
   - Implement in parallel with existing BaseFacet

3. Third stage:
   - Create one test collection that uses the new architecture
   - Validate it works correctly
   - Ensure it maintains backward compatibility

### Step 3: Gradual Migration

1. Migrate each collection one by one
2. Thoroughly test after each migration
3. Only when all collections are migrated, merge functionality

## Immediate Action

1. Clean up all syntax errors
2. Restore compilable state
3. Implement core parts of the new architecture without breaking existing code
