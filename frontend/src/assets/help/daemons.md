The Daemons view displays a list of daemons that are currently being monitored. The list includes the daemon name, the daemon's IP address, the daemon's status, and the daemon's last check-in time. The list can be sorted by any of these columns by clicking on the column header. The list can also be filtered by entering text in the filter box at the top of the list.
