This view shows the ABIs of the contracts that TrueBlocks is aware of. They are downloaded from EtherScan each time the user studies a history that includes a given address. The ABIs are used to add detail to an address's history. In the future, we will use this to interact with the contract. The ABIs are shown in JSON format.
