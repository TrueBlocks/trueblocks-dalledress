# Implementation Plan for Store-Owned Data Architecture

## Current Status

We've successfully implemented a parallel version of the architecture in separate packages:

1. **Enhanced Store (`pkg/enhancedstore`)**
   - Store owns data with proper thread safety
   - Implements observer pattern for notifications
   - State management for tracking load status
   - Decoupled from facets through interfaces

2. **Enhanced Facet (`pkg/enhancedfacet`)**
   - Maintains view as pointers to store data
   - Implements FacetObserver interface
   - Decoupled data fetching from display

3. **Demo Collection (`pkg/enhancedcollection`)**
   - Example implementation using the new architecture
   - Demonstrates the pattern for migrating existing collections

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Compilation Issues**
   - Complete the demo collection implementation
   - Resolve issues with the Modeler interface
   - Ensure the parallel implementation compiles cleanly

2. **Evaluate the Parallel Implementation**
   - Test the demo collection functionality
   - Compare performance with existing implementation
   - Verify cancellation works properly

3. **Decide Migration Strategy**
   - **Option A: Parallel Migration**
     - Keep both implementations side by side
     - Migrate collections one by one
     - This minimizes risk but requires more code

   - **Option B: Integrated Migration**
     - Enhance existing Store and BaseFacet classes directly
     - Migrate collections in place
     - This is more efficient but higher risk

## Immediate Action Items

1. Complete the demo collection
   - Implement manual data loading method for testing
   - Add proper test cases

2. Create test program
   - Simple app to validate the enhanced architecture
   - Focus on store ownership and observation pattern
   - Test cancellation functionality

3. Test with a real domain collection
   - Choose a simpler collection like Names or Abis
   - Create parallel implementation
   - Compare behavior with original implementation

## Decision Criteria

The choice between Option A and B should be based on:

1. How well the demo collection works
2. Confidence in backward compatibility
3. Complexity of the integration
4. Timeline constraints

## Overall Recommendation

Start with the parallel approach (Option A) to validate the architecture.
Once proven, we can either continue with parallel migration or
switch to integrated migration if we're confident in compatibility.
