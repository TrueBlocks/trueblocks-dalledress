# Names Management

Welcome to the **Names** view! This section allows you to manage address names and their associated metadata in the TrueBlocks system.

## Tabs Overview

1. **All**: Displays all names across all categories
2. **Custom**: User-created custom names for addresses
3. **Prefund**: Genesis and pre-funding addresses
4. **Regular**: Standard addresses with names
5. **Baddress**: Flagged or problematic addresses

## Features

### View and Search

- Search and filter names by address, name, or other fields
- Sort by any column (address, name, tags, source, etc.)

### CRUD Operations
